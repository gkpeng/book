BEIJING -- The Ministry of Justice on Friday pledged strong efforts on tightening commutation and parole rules, in a bid to prevent judicial staff from taking bribes and cutting prisoners slack.

The Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on Feb 24 released an instruction, saying "granting commutation, parole and serving a sentence outside jail for medical reasons should be stringently within the framework of the law."

The instruction focuses on three kinds of crimes, namely taking advantage of one's position, disrupting financial order and financial fraud, and organizing mafia-style groups.

The Ministry of Justice said it is going to launch an online platform so that such cases can be monitored online.

The ministry plans to verify case-by-case remissions granted within the last three years to criminals involved in the three target crimes.
